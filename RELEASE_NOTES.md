**zhandu v0.1.1** adds `-g GROUP` as a short form of `--group GROUP`.

- Count only entries owned by the selected group in TUI and JSON totals.
- Traverse directories of other groups to include matching descendants.
- Accept group names or Unix GIDs, and Windows primary-group names or SIDs.
- Install with `cargo install zhandu --locked`.

Windows uses file owner and primary-group SIDs, not ACL access groups. JSON includes persistent SID strings; numeric Windows owner IDs are process-local intern keys. Use account names or SIDs for command-line filters. Unreadable file metadata/security descriptors produce incomplete results. Reparse points, including junctions, are not traversed. NTFS is the primary Windows filesystem target; ReFS/FAT and network shares have not been validated.

The archives are not notarized or Authenticode-signed. All five native build/test jobs must succeed before the workflow publishes this release.
